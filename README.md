# History

BlackCat CMS was originally based on LEPTON v2.0 Alpha, as released in May
2012, which itself was based on Website Baker v2.8.2. So, Black Cat CMS is what
is called a "fork", but has evolved differently and taken it's own way since
end of year 2012.

The name "BlackCat" is derived from the forum names of the founders:
creative<strong>cat</strong> and <strong>Black</strong>Bird.
